# Covid_19_Analysis
The provided code performs statistical analysis on the COVID-19 line list data. It explores the relationship between various variables and the likelihood of death from COVID-19. Here's a summary of the code's functionality:

    The code imports the "Hmisc" package and installs it if necessary.
    The "COVID19_line_list_data" dataset is assigned to the "data" variable.
    The first few rows of the data are displayed using head(data).
    The describe() function from the "Hmisc" package is used to provide summary statistics of the dataset.
    A new variable "death_dummy" is created to indicate whether a death occurred (1) or not (0).
    The code calculates the death rate as a percentage.
    The code analyzes the relationship between age and death by comparing the mean age of deceased individuals and surviving individuals. A t-test is performed to assess the statistical significance of the difference.
    The code examines the relationship between gender and death by comparing the death rates of men and women. Again, a t-test is performed to determine the statistical significance.
